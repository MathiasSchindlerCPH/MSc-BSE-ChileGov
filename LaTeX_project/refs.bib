	abstract = {As users interact via social media spaces, like Twitter, they form connections that emerge into complex social network structures. These connections are indicators of content sharing, and network structures reflect patterns of information flow. This article proposes a conceptual and practical model for the classification of topical Twitter networks, based on their network-level structures. As current literature focuses on the classification of users to key positions, this study utilizes the overall network structures in order to classify Twitter conversation based on their patterns of information flow. Four network-level metrics, which have established as indicators of information flow characteristics—density, modularity, centralization, and the fraction of isolated users—are utilized in a three-step classification model. This process led us to suggest six structures of information flow: divided, unified, fragmented, clustered, in and out hub-and-spoke networks. We demonstrate the value of these network structures by segmenting 60 Twitter topical social media network datasets into these six distinct patterns of collective connections, illustrating how different topics of conversations exhibit different patterns of information flow. We discuss conceptual and practical implications for each structure.},

	abstract = {Mood is an emerging metadata type and access point in music digital libraries (MDL) and online music repositories. In this study, we present a comprehensive investigation of the usefulness of lyrics in music mood classification by evaluating and comparing a wide range of lyric text features including linguistic and text stylistic features. We then combine the best lyric features with features extracted from music audio using two fusion methods. The results show that combining lyrics and audio significantly outperformed systems using audio-only features. In addition, the examination of learning curves shows that the hybrid lyric + audio system needed fewer training samples to achieve the same or better classification accuracies than systems using lyrics or audio singularly. These experiments were conducted on a unique large-scale dataset of 5,296 songs (with both audio and lyrics for each) representing 18 mood categories derived from social tags. The findings push forward the state-of-the-art on lyric sentiment analysis and automatic music mood classification and will help make mood a practical access point in music digital libraries.},

	abstract = {Social Media are sensors in the real world that can be used to measure the pulse of societies. However, the massive and unﬁltered feed of messages posted in social media is a phenomenon that nowadays raises social alarms, especially when these messages contain hate speech targeted to a speciﬁc individual or group. In this context, governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are concerned about the possible negative impact that these messages can have on individuals or on the society. In this paper, we present HaterNet, an intelligent system currently being used by the Spanish National Ofﬁce Against Hate Crimes of the Spanish State Secretariat for Security that identiﬁes and monitors the evolution of hate speech in Twitter. The contributions of this research are many-fold: (1) It introduces the ﬁrst intelligent system that monitors and visualizes, using social network analysis techniques, hate speech in Social Media. (2) It introduces a novel public dataset on hate speech in Spanish consisting of 6000 expert-labeled tweets. (3) It compares several classiﬁcation approaches based on different document representation strategies and text classiﬁcation models. (4) The best approach consists of a combination of a LTSM+MLP neural network that takes as input the tweet’s word, emoji, and expression tokens’ embeddings enriched by the tf-idf, and obtains an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.828 on our dataset, outperforming previous methods presented in the literature.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, due to the great uncontrolled content posted daily on the Web, there has also been a huge increase in the dissemination of hate speech worldwide. Social media, blogs and community forums are examples where people are freely allowed to communicate. However, freedom of expression is not always respectful since offensive or insulting language is sometimes used. Social media companies often rely on users and content moderators to report on this type of content. Nevertheless, due to the large amount of content generated every day on the Web, automatic systems based on Natural Language Processing techniques are required for identifying abusive language online. To date, most of the systems developed to combat this problem are mainly focused on English content, but this issue is a worldwide concern and therefore other languages such as Spanish are involved. In this paper, we address the task of Spanish hate speech identification on social media and provide a deeper understanding of the capabilities of new techniques based on machine learning. In particular, we compare the performance of Deep Learning methods with recently pre-trained language models based on Transfer Learning as well as with traditional machine learning models. Our main contribution is the achievement of promising results in Spanish by applying multilingual and monolingual pre-trained language models such as BERT, XLM and BETO.},

abstract = {The rising popularity of social media posts, most notably Twitter posts, as a data source for social science research poses significant problems with regard to access to representative, high-quality data for analysis. Cheap, publicly available data such as that obtained from Twitter's public application programming interfaces is often of low quality, while high-quality data is expensive both financially and computationally. Moreover, data is often available only in real-time, making post-hoc analysis difficult or impossible. We propose and test a methodology for inexpensively creating an archive of Twitter data through population sampling, yielding a database that is highly representative of the targeted user population (in this test case, the entire population of Japanese-language Twitter users). Comparing the tweet volume, keywords, and topics found in our sample data set with the ground truth of Twitter's full data feed confirmed a very high degree of representativeness in the sample. We conclude that this approach yields a data set that is suitable for a wide range of post-hoc analyses, while remaining cost effective and accessible to a wide range of researchers.}

	abstract = {The widespread adoption of social media for political communication creates unprecedented opportunities to monitor the opinions of large numbers of politically active individuals in real time. However, without a way to distinguish between users of opposing political alignments, conﬂicting signals at the individual level may, in the aggregate, obscure partisan differences in opinion that are important to political strategy. In this article we describe several methods for predicting the political alignment of Twitter users based on the content and structure of their political communication in the run-up to the 2010 U.S. midterm elections. Using a data set of 1,000 manuallyannotated individuals, we ﬁnd that a support vector machine ({SVM}) trained on hashtag metadata outperforms an {SVM} trained on the full text of users’ tweets, yielding predictions of political afﬁliations with 91\% accuracy. Applying latent semantic analysis to the content of users’ tweets we identify hidden structure in the data strongly associated with political afﬁliation, but do not ﬁnd that topic detection improves prediction performance. All of these content-based methods are outperformed by a classiﬁer based on the segregated community structure of political information diffusion networks (95\% accuracy). We conclude with a practical application of this machinery to web-based political advertising, and outline several approaches to public opinion monitoring based on the techniques developed herein.},
